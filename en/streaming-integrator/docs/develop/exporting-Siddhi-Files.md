# Exporting Siddhi Files

The Siddhi files you create in the [Stream Processor
Studio](_Stream_Processor_Studio_Overview_) are saved in the
`         <SP_HOME>/wso2/editor/deployment/workspace        ` directory
by default. If you want to save a Siddhi file in a different location,
you can export it to the required location. You can also enable Siddhi
applications to be run in a Docker environment by exporting them as
Docker artifacts. For detailed information about the different purposes
for whcih the Siddhi applications are exported and the methods you can
adopt to export them, see the following sections.
