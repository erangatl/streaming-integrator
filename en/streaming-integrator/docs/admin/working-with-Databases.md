# Working with Databases

WSO2 SP stores product-specific data in the H2 database located in the
`         <SP_HOME>/wso2/<RunTime>/database        ` directory by
default.

This embedded H2 database is suitable for development, testing, and for
some production environments. For most production environments, however,
we recommend you to use an industry-standard RDBMS such as Oracle,
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL. Most table schemas are self generated by the
feature itself. For others, you can use the scripts provided with WSO2
SP (in the `         <SP_HOME>/wso2/<RunTime>/dbscripts        `
directory) to install and configure databases, including Oracle,
PostgreSQL, MySQL and MS SQL.

queries:
