# Configuring Endpoints using REST APIs

In addition to exposing RESTful interfaces and mediating RESTful
invocations by mapping REST concepts to SOAP via [proxy
services](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI650/Using+REST+with+a+Proxy+Service)
, you can use the WSO2 Enterprise Integrator REST API to configure REST
endpoints in the Enterprise Integrator by directly specifying HTTP
verbs, URL patterns, URI templates, HTTP media types, and other related
headers. You can define REST APIs and associated resources in the
Enterprise Integrator by combining REST APIs with mediation features
provided by the underlying messaging framework.

For more information, see [Working with
APIs](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI650/Working+with+APIs) and [Sample
800: Introduction to REST
API](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI610/Sample+800%3A+Introduction+to+REST+API)
