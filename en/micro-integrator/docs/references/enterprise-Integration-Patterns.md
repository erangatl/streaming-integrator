# Enterprise Integration Patterns

Over the years, architects have invented a blend of integration patterns
for connecting various business applications within enterprise systems.
Most of these architectures have similarities, initiating a set of
widely accepted standards in integration patterns. These standards are
described in the **Enterprise Integration Patterns Catalog** available
at: http://www.eaipatterns.com/toc.html .

You can simulate most of the patterns in the catalog using various
constructs of the ESB profile of WSO2 EI. For ideas on how to design
your integrations, and to get step-by-step instructions using example
scenarios, see [Enterprise Integration Patterns with WSO2 Enterprise
Integrator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EIP/Enterprise+Integration+Patterns+with+WSO2+Enterprise+Integrator)
. You can then refer back to this guide for details on the mediators
used in the scenarios, how to work with endpoints and proxy services,
and so on.
